# Timeless Songs - Back end
## Description
Welcome to my project. This is a web app on which you can look up bands, see the songs they've made
and more.
## Used technologies
We created the back end with Java 21 and the Spring boot framework, using version 3.4.4.
We chose this as it is what we have the most experience with.
For our database needs we picked SQLite as a small and reliable solution for the needs of our app.
## Reason for this project
There are several reasons why I'm doing this project, with the help of my mentor.
First and foremost is continuing improving my expertise with Java & Spring boot 
and be able to showcase such a project as part of my portfolio.
Next is working on improving my skills with VCS and specifically GitHub as I am somewhat lacking in this field,
but this project has already seen great improvements for me with this.
