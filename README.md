# Timeless Songs - Back end
## Description
Welcome to our project. This is a web app on which you can look up bands, see the songs they've made
and more.
## Used technologies
We created the back end with Java 21 and the Spring boot framework, using version 3.4.4.
We chose this as it is what we have the most experience with.
For our database needs we picked SQLite as a small and reliable solution for the needs of our app.
